 # Project Background
Fashion Fusion is a prominent retail brand operating in major urban areas like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. While it has established a strong market presence, the company faces a significant challenge due to a disconnect between its promotional activities and local consumer purchasing patterns. This gap limits its ability to effectively seize local market opportunities, which is critical for growth.

To maintain its competitive edge and meet the distinct demands of each urban area, Fashion Fusion must develop a deeper understanding of regional product and brand preferences. Failing to address this issue could result in a loss of market share to more agile competitors in a dynamic marketplace.

Insights are provided on the following key areas:

- **Top-Selling Products by City:** These findings will assist in strategic decision-making by optimizing local advertising and in-store promotions, ultimately maximizing revenue in each target city.

- **Most Popular Brands by City:** The analysis identified the top-performing brand in terms of sales for each city. This information is essential for crafting brand-specific marketing and inventory management strategies, allowing the company to effectively leverage established brand loyalty across different regions.

# Data Structure Check
The Fashion Fusion Database consists of three tables: transaction_dim, customers_dim, and product_name_dim.

*These ERD show the relationship between each tables in the database*

# Executive Summary
### Overview Of Findings 
Low transaction volume of only 750 orders, indicating limited customer traffic; a heavy reliance on apparel, which makes up 74% of sales, while accessories only contribute 2.4%, suggesting a potential for growth in high-margin add-ons; and an inventory risk due to outerwear being the top product without insight into stock age or sell-through rates, which could lead to seasonal markdowns if demand slows.

- **Top-Selling Products by City:** 

1. Revenue leadership changes hands based on very narrow margins. 
Lagos finishes the period just ₦29.50 ahead of Port Harcourt (₦13,238 vs. ₦13,208) and ₦279.50 ahead of Abuja (₦12,958). 
This means that one additional pair of shoes sold in Abuja would have moved that city into second place, while a single jacket sale in Lagos could have increased its lead to over ₦150. 
Overall, the three markets are essentially the same size; it is local execution, not macro demand, that determines which city "wins" each week.

    | City  | Total Items Sold | Aggregate Revenue | Avg. Price per Item |
    | ----- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
    | Abuja | 250              | **12,958.50**     | 51.83                 |
    | Lagos | 251              | **13,238.00**     | 52.74                 |
    | PH    | 249              | **13,208.50**     | 53.05                 |

2. Outer-wear (jackets + shoes) accounts for 57 % of all money taken across the country, yet shows two divergent price stories
Jackets: perfect price discipline – every city holds the ₦120 tag, so the extra ₦240 revenue lead Port-Harcourt enjoys over Abuja is purely volume-driven (32 vs 30 units).
Shoes: Port-Harcourt moves the most pairs (34) but at the lowest ASP (₦94.85), whereas Lagos sells fewer (31) at the highest ASP (₦99.19).
→ There is head-room to raise shoe ASP in PH without sacrificing units; conversely Abuja could chase a few extra shoe units to close the revenue gap.

3. 
    - Abuja: Slightly lower ASP; bestseller volume on belts
    - Lagos: Balanced mix; tops in revenue thanks to one extra shoe sale  
    - Port-Harcourt: Highest ASP overall; strongest jacket & shoe performance; weakest in men’s jeans
